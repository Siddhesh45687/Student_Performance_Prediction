# 🎓 Student Predictive Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project applies **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict student performance. 
The main goal is to identify students at risk of underperforming or dropping out so that educators can 
provide early interventions and personalized support.

## 🚀 Workflow
- Data Collection from academic and demographic sources.
- Data Preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
- Feature Engineering to select relevant variables affecting performance.
- Model Training using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- Model Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Final Prediction using the best-performing model.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## 📊 Results
- The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy (~85–90%).  
- Key performance indicators: attendance, assignment submission, and consistent study habits.  
- The system effectively identifies students needing early academic support.

## ✅ Conclusion
The **Student Predictive Analysis Project** shows how data-driven insights can help improve educational 
outcomes. Predictive analytics enables institutions to reduce dropout rates and promote student success 
by identifying risks early and providing the right interventions.
